Using the Telco customer dataset, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify different customer groups based on spending, service usage, and churn patterns.
Key steps included:
✔ Data preprocessing & feature encoding
 ✔ Scaling numerical features
 ✔ K-Means clustering
 ✔ PCA visualization for better interpretability
 ✔ Segment-wise churn analysis
 Tools Used:
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-Learn | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Plotly
